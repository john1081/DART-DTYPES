  // Comments explaining each data type and its use

  // int: Represents integer values, such as age.
  // double: Represents floating-point values, such as weight.
  // String: Represents a sequence of characters, such as a person's name.
  // List: Represents an ordered collection of items, such as a list of colors.
  // Map: Represents a collection of key-value pairs, such as person's information.

  // Testing for accuracy and performance
  // Note: Dart is an interpreted language, and for smaller programs like this, performance is not a significant concern.

  // Additional testing and optimizations can be performed based on specific use cases.
